# SAĞLIK KURULUŞLARI
This is a mobile application that combines RxSwift and MVVM-C architecture. The user interfaces were programmatically built using SnapKit for layout. AutoLayout was implemented. Animations were implemented using Core Animation. The navigation flow was controlled using the Coordinator pattern, ensuring the avoidance of Retain Cycles and Memory Leaks. This application integrated with RevenueCat and Firebase for in-app purchase management. Firebase Remote Config was used to manage data for the main screen's horizontal collection view. Push Notifications were implemented using Firebase. Apple requirements were implemented (such as Restore Purchase, Revoke Token).
